            <p>Indian agriculture benefited from the developments made in the
                 field of biotechnology, for which the Department of Biotechnology
                  was created in 1986 under the Ministry of Science and Technology.
                   Both the Indian private sector and the government have invested in
                    the medical and agricultural applications of biotechnology.
                     Massive biotech parks were established in India while the government
                      provided tax deduction for research and development under biotechnological firms.</p>

                      <p>The Indian economy underwent economic reforms in 1991, leading to a new era of
                         globalisation and international economic integration. Economic growth of over 6%
                          annually was seen between 1993 and 2002. Same year a new permanent Antarctic base
                           Maitri was founded and remains in operation till date.</p>

                             in the field of science and technology. A joint EU-India group of scholars was
                             formed on 23 November 2001 to further promote joint research and development.
                              India holds Associate Member State status at CERN, while a joint India-EU Software
