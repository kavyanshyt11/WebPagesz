                       <p class="p2">India aimed "to convert India's
                        economy into that of a modern
                         state and to fit her into the
                          nuclear age and do it quickly.</p>
                               <br>

                               <p>Planning Commission (1950) fixed investment levels, prescribed priorities, divided funds between agriculture
                                 and industry, and divided resources between the state and the federal governments. The result of the efforts
                                  between 1947 and 1962 saw the area under irrigation increase by 45 million acres (180,000 km2), food production
                                   rise by 34 million metric tons, installed power generating capacity increase by 79 million kilowatts, and an overall
                                    increase of 94 percent in industrial production. The enormous population rise, however, would balance the gains. 
                                    The economically beleaguered country was nevertheless able to build a large scientific workforce, second in numbers only
                                     to that of the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>

                                <p>Education—provided by the government of India—was free and compulsory up to the Age of 14 because
                                    education is the most
                                         important single factor that leads to economic growth [based on] the development of science and technology.

                                      <p>On 18 August 1951 the minister of education Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, inaugurated the Indian Institute of Technology at
                                         Kharagpur in West Bengal. Possibly modeled after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology these institutions were conceived
                                          by a 22-member committee of scholars and entrepreneurs under the chairmanship of N. R. Sarkar.</p>
