        <p>After independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of
        India, initiated reforms to promote higher education and science
        and technology in India. The Indian Institute of Technology (
        —conceived by a 22-member committee of scholars and 
        entrepreneurs in order to promote technical education—was 
        inaugurated on 18 August 1951 at Kharagpur in West Bengal by the
         minister of education Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. More IITs were
          soon opened in many big cities too.</p>
               <br>
               
               <p>India accounts for about 10% of all expenditure on research and
                 development in Asia and the number of scientific publications grew
                  by 45% over the five years to 2007. However, according to former
                   Indian science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, India is lagging
                    in science and technology compared to developed countries. India has only 140 researchers per
                     1,000,000 population, compared to 4,651 in the United States.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>While India has increased its output of scientific papers fourfold between 2000 and 2015 overtaking
                             Russia and France in absolute number of papers per year, that rate has been exceeded by China and
                              Brazil; Indian papers generate fewer cites than average, and relative to its population it has few
                               scientists.</p>
                               <br>
                         <p>India is ranked 40th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.</p>
