            <p>The roots of nuclear power in India lie in the early acquisition
                 of nuclear reactor technology from several western countries, particularly
                 the American support for the Tarapur Atomic Power Station and Canada's CANDU
                reactors.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Stanley Wolpert (2008) describes the measures taken by the Indian government
                    to increase agricultural output:</p>

                    <p>The Indian space program received only financial support from the Soviet Union,
                        which helped the Indian Space Research Organisation achieve aims such as establishing
                        the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station, launching remote sensing satellites,
                        developing India's first satelliteâ€”Aryabhatta, and sending astronauts into space.
                        India sustained its nuclear program during the aftermath of Operation Smiling Buddha,
                         the country's first nuclear tests.</p>
                         <br>
                         <p>The Ministry of Steel and Mines drafted a policy statement to evolve a new model for
                             managing industry. The policy statement was presented to the Parliament on 2 December 1972.
                              On this basis, the concept of creating a holding company to manage inputs and outputs under one
                               umbrella was mooted. This led to the formation of Steel Authority of India Ltd. The company, incorporated
                                on 24 January 1973 with an authorized capital of Rs. 2000 crore, was made responsible for managing five integrated
                                 steel plants at Bhilai, Bokaro, Durgapur, Rourkela and Burnpur, the Alloy Steel Plant and the Salem Steel Plant. In 1978 SAIL
                                  was restructured as an operating company.</p>

                                  <p>In 1981, the Indian Antarctic Programme was started when the first Indian expedition was flagged off for Antarctica from Goa. More missions
                                     were subsequently sent each year to India's base Dakshin Gangotri.</p>
